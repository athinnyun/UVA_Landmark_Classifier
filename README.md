# UVA Landmark Classifier

In this project, I trained and evaluated three different CNN-based models via transfer learning to classify different landmarks at the University of Virginia. With 18 different classes, I was able to achieve a final test accuracy of 86.94%. Credits to Rich Nguyen for providing the dataset and preprocessing code.
